# Reverse-engineering-of-missile-launcher-Truck.
# Abstract
A unique approach to design a 3D model of missile launcher toy truck (figure 1.1) using 3d
experience software. The process begins with the reverse engineering of the physical model (missile
launcher toy truck). Reverse-engineering is the act of dismantling an object to see how it works. It is done
mostly to examine and learn how something works, but it is also frequently used to reproduce or improve
the object. Reverse engineering is adapted to design each component of the toy and eventually
assemble the designed components using assembly design workbench in 3D experience.

# components
The missile launcher truck has 11 components in total. They are as follows,
1) Chassis
2) Cabin
3)Cabin component
4) Launchpad
5) Upper Launchpad
6) Missile
7) Missile cap
8) Wheels (x4)
9) Wheel axle (x2)
10) Hexagonal bolt (x3)
11) Nuts (x4)
# METHODOLOGY
All the above-mentioned components are initially dismantled (The process of reverse engineering) and are
measured using various measuring tools. After measuring the components 2D sketches are drawn. By referring
to the hand-drawn 2D sketches all the components are designed in 3D experience software using a couple of
workbenches namely, part design workbench and generative wireframe workbench. Eventually, all the 3D
designed components are assembled using an assembly design workbench to build the ultimate 3D product.
